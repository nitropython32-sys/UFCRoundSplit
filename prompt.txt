You are a vision-language model. Examine the image carefully.

Task:
1. Determine if a UFC time clock is visible on screen.
2. The clock normally shows both:
   - The time remaining in the round (e.g., "4:12", "2:07")
   - The round indicator (e.g., "1 of 3", "2 of 5", or a small group of white lines).
3. If a time clock is visible:
   - Return a JSON object in this format:
     {"time": "<time_remaining>", "round": "<round_number_or_label>"}
4. If **no clock** is visible (e.g., between rounds, replays, or ads):
   - Return exactly this JSON:
     {"time": null, "round": null}

Rules:
- You must NEVER guess values. If the clock is unclear, cropped, or partially hidden, treat it as missing.
- Do not write explanations or extra text outside the JSON.
- Your entire output must be **valid JSON only**.
